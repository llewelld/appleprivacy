# Apple Privacy Statements

This icon appears when an Apple feature asks to use your personal information.

You won’t see this with every feature since Apple collects this information only when needed to enable features, secure our services, or personalize your experience.

Apple believes privacy is a fundamental human right, so every Apple product is designed to minimize the collection and use of your data, use on-device processing whenever possible, and provide transparency and control over your information.

## App Store and Privacy

App Store, iTunes Store, iBooks Store, Videos, and iTunes U are designed to protect your information and let you choose when you share.

- We collect your personal information so that we can provide you the content you purchase, download, or wish to update.

- We also use information about your account, browsing, purchases, and downloads in the Stores to offer advertising to ensure that Search Ads in the App Store and ads in Apple News, where available, are relevant to you. You have choices with respect to this advertising, as described below.

- We use information about your purchases, downloads, and other activities in the Stores to tailor features and offer personalized recommendations for you. You can opt out of the use of this data for this purpose, as described below.

- To find ways to improve our Stores, we use information about your browsing, purchases, searches, and downloads. These records are stored with IP address, a random unique identifier (where that arises), and Apple ID when you are signed in to a Store.

Providing the Stores

We use your personal information to provide the services and features in the Stores. This information includes, for example, your account and payment information, which you can access and change in settings, and your purchase history.

When you download from a Store, or install an app on your Apple Watch, identifiers such as your device’s hardware ID and IP address are logged by Apple along with your Apple ID.

In order to preserve your play position in the Videos app, we store and sync that position across your signed-in iOS devices.

Improving the Stores

To improve the experience in the Stores, we collect information about your usage of the Stores, including when you open or close a Store, what content you search for, and the content you view and download. We also collect information about your device such as the type of device, the version of your operating system, and the amount of free space on your device. We may use this information to assess whether requested content can be downloaded, to understand general trends in use of device storage, and whether your device is connected by Wi-Fi or cellular. We can use this information to improve your experience in the Stores in the following ways: 
 
What you searched for makes it possible for us to offer trending searches

Knowing what content you viewed or download makes it possible for us to offer personalized features like “More Games You Might Like”

Knowing the free space on your device allowed us to build the feature that lets you buy movies on your iPhone without downloading it at purchase

Additionally, if you have Popular Near Me enabled in Location Services, your iPhone will periodically send locations of when and where you have purchased or used apps in an anonymous and encrypted form to Apple, and may then be used to offer geographically relevant apps and other Apple products and services.

Personalizing the Stores

We may personalize the Stores to help you discover the content that’s most relevant to you. For example, we recommend movies that we think will be of interest to you based on movies you’ve previously watched. Personalization features can be turned off by sliding the Personalized Recommendations switch for your Apple ID in the iTunes & App Store Settings, and some may require your permission before they are turned on. To provide personalization, we use information about your purchases, downloads, browsing, and other activities in the Stores. This information is stored in association with your Apple ID.

Advertising

Search Ads is an easy way for developers to promote their apps within App Store search results, helping people discover apps. We use information about your device, account, purchases, downloads, and browsing, including search terms, in Stores in order to ensure that ads in the Stores are relevant. We create groups of people, called segments, who share similar characteristics and we use these groups for delivering targeted ads. Information about you is used to determine which segments you are assigned to, and thus, which ads you receive. To protect your privacy, your information is used to place you into segments of at least 5,000 people. If you do not wish to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple’s advertising platform, you can choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking, which will opt your Apple ID out of receiving such ads on devices where you are signed in with the same Apple ID.

We also use similar information from the Stores to make ads in Apple News more relevant, but in a way that is tied to an identifier specific to Apple News and not tied to your Apple ID.

Learn about how to opt out of interest-based ads in the App Store and Apple News here. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074

If you choose to limit ad tracking, you will still receive ads based on search terms you enter.

Sharing with third parties

We are obligated to provide some non-personal information about your content purchases to strategic partners, such as app developers and/or content owners so that they can measure the performance of their creative work, meet royalty and accounting requirements, and improve their products and services.

We may share information with developers to help them operate and improve their apps. Developers can access usage information, provided by users who opt in, that allows them to look at aggregated data from groups of users that have similar characteristics or behavior, as long the data comes from groups of no less than five users. Developers can access receipt information for purchases of their products and services in the Stores. Receipts do not include personal information; however, developers could seek to associate them with personal information from your use and download of their apps, if you have provided it to them.

If you purchase a subscription in a third-party app, we create a Subscriber ID that is unique to you and the developer or publisher. You can learn more about Subscriber ID here https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207233.	

Retention

We retain personal information associated with your purchases and downloads on our Stores for the periods specified by applicable laws relating to financial reporting which vary by country. For most customers that requires at least a ten year retention period. We also retain a record of your purchase and downloads of content for at least as long as you have an account with us to allow you to redownload that content in line with our applicable terms on redownloads. We retain other information such as browsing activity and searches for a shorter period. The period chosen takes account of applicable legal requirements to retain data and specific business use cases. However, some information, such as purchases, but not your stored card details may be retained as business records even after you close your account or stop using the Stores.

Preventing fraud and other malicious activity

We also collect personal information to prevent fraud and other malicious activity in the Stores and other Apple apps and services. This information includes device information, such as device type and software version, location information, if available, download and purchase history, and other interactions with the Stores.

At all times Apple collects and uses information in accordance with our privacy policy located at www.apple.com/privacy

## App Anaytics

Analytics is designed to protect your information and enable you to choose what you share.

App Analytics

To help Apple’s partners and third-party developers improve their apps, products and services designed for use with Apple products, Apple may provide such partners or developers with a subset of analytics information that is relevant to that partner’s or developer’s app, product or service, as long as the analytics information and statistics are aggregated or in a form that does not personally identify you.

You may choose not to share crash data and statistics about how you use apps with third-party app developers. To do so, open System Preferences, click Security & Privacy, then click Privacy.

Click Analytics.

Deselect “Share with App Developers” to stop sharing analytics data with app developers.

By using these features, you agree and consent to Apple’s and its subsidiaries’ and agents’ transmission, collection, maintenance, processing and use of this information as described above.

At all times, information received by Apple will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, which can be found at www.apple.com/privacy

## Apple ID

Apple ID is designed to protect your information and enable you to choose what you share.

- When you sign in with your Apple ID you will enable services such as iCloud, the App Store, iMessage, and Find My Mac on this Mac.

- Certain data including your contacts, calendars, photos, documents, health, activity, and other app data, will be sent to Apple to store and back up on your behalf.

- In addition, your device will be associated with your Apple ID to provide you with better service and support.

Your Apple ID and all Apple services are designed from the ground up to protect your privacy. We work hard to collect only the data we need to make your experience better. When we do collect data, we believe it’s important for you to know what we’re collecting and why we need it, so you can make informed choices.

An Apple ID is the personal account you use to access Apple services like iCloud, the App Store, iTunes Store, iMessage, and FaceTime, and access your content across all your devices and the web. Your Apple ID includes the information you use to sign in, as well as all the contact, payment, and security details such as trusted phone numbers or security questions that you use across Apple services. Your device’s name, serial number and other hardware identifiers are also retained to provide you with better service and support. You can edit your Apple ID information and view a list of your devices on your Apple ID account page (https://appleid.apple.com).

When you sign in with your Apple ID you will enable services such as iCloud, the iTunes Store, the App Store, iMessage, FaceTime, and Find My Mac on this Mac. Your Apple ID account information will be used with each service and certain data from your device including your contacts, calendars, photos, documents, health, activity, Safari tabs, and other app data, will be sent to Apple to store and back up on your behalf.

iCloud and Privacy

Signing in to iCloud

When you use iCloud, certain data you store on your device will be automatically sent to and stored by Apple. This allows you to access your data on all your iCloud-enabled devices or computers (“Devices”) automatically. This data may include:

Contacts 
Calendars 
Reminders 
Bookmarks 
Safari tabs
Health data 
Home data
Notes
Photos
Documents
Wallet data
Keychain and passwords
Device and account settings
Data from third-party apps that use iCloud

You can adjust which iCloud features are enabled and what data is sent to iCloud from Settings on your device at any time.

iCloud Data Security

iCloud protects your information by encrypting it when it’s in transit, storing it in iCloud in an encrypted format, and using secure tokens for authentication. For certain information, Apple uses end-to-end encryption. This means that by design, only you can access this information, and only on devices where you’re signed in to iCloud. No one else, not even Apple, can access end-to-end encrypted information. For more information on iCloud Data Security, see https://support.apple.com/kb/HT202303

In some cases, your iCloud data may be stored using third party partners’ servers, however, Apple never provides encryption keys to any third parties.

iCloud Keychain 

iCloud Keychain keeps your Safari website usernames and passwords, credit card information, and Wi-Fi network information up to date and available across all your devices. It can also store the account information you use for Mail, Contacts, Calendar, Messages, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other internet accounts and automatically add this information to all of your devices.

iCloud Keychain uses end-to-end encryption and is designed so that only you can access this information and only on devices where you’re signed in to iCloud. No one else, not even Apple, can access your iCloud keychain data. You can choose to turn off iCloud Keychain in your iCloud settings at any time.

Sharing Data with iCloud

If you use iCloud to share files either publicly or privately in Notes, Pages, Numbers, Keynote, and certain third-party Apps, Apple will store and have access to the shared file. Your first and last name associated with your account and the file name will be available to anyone who has access to the sharing link regardless of whether your share is private or public. The identities of private share participants will not be made available to anyone that has not been invited to and accepted the private share.

iCloud and Apps

Some apps use iCloud to store data and content you provide to the app, so you can access the data across all your iCloud enabled devices. The app may choose to store some or all of your data in iCloud. Third party apps can request to “Look you Up”, so that other users of that application can see your first and last name when they search by Apple ID. 

You can stop an app from storing data in iCloud by turning the app off in iCloud settings under Apps Using iCloud.

Find My Mac

When you sign in and enable iCloud on your device, certain features of Find My Mac are enabled automatically. These include the ability to play a sound on your device, remotely lock and display a message on it, or remotely erase it. If you also enable Location Services, Find My Mac can help you locate your device on a map or see where a supported accessory was last connected. If you choose to enable the Send Last Location feature, your device’s last known location will be automatically sent to Apple any time your device’s battery reaches a critically low level. 

When you use Find My Mac, your device’s location, as well as information about your device and your account will be sent to and retained by Apple so Apple can provide you with the service. Your device’s location is only sent to Apple if you actively request the location of a device or accessory. Apple retains location information and makes it accessible to you for 24 hours, after which it is deleted.

You can turn off Find My Mac on your device by opening System Preferences, clicking iCloud, and deselecting the checkbox next to Find My Mac.

Find My Friends and Share My Location

When you have Location Services enabled, you can share your device’s current location with anyone you choose using Find My Friends and Share My Location. When using these features, your location is only sent to Apple if it is actively requested by a friend you are sharing with, and retained for 2 hours, after which it is deleted.

Find My Friends and Share My Location are only enabled when you actively choose to share your location with someone else.

Apple services that require iCloud

To use Apple services like Apple Pay, Activity sharing, Home, Handoff, Universal Clipboard, and auto-unlock with Apple Watch, you must be signed in to iCloud on your device. However, you do not need to use all iCloud features. You can turn off any iCloud features you don’t want to use in iCloud settings on your device. 

Signing out of iCloud

If you wish to stop using iCloud on your iOS device and any paired Apple Watch, you may sign out of iCloud by going to Settings, tapping your Apple ID and tapping the Sign Out button. To stop using iCloud on your Mac, go to the iCloud pane within System Preferences and sign out of iCloud. Your Apple ID password may be required.

Family Sharing

Family sharing enables you to share purchases among family members. Any members of your family will be able to access your purchases and view your purchase history. If you enable purchase sharing, your family organizer will also receive receipts for any purchases made in the App Store, iBooks, and iTunes. To hide purchases, disable Share My Purchases within Family Sharing settings. If you choose to share your location with your family, all family members you share with will be able to see the location of all your devices, unless you choose not to enable the Find my Mac in Location Services, System Services settings on your device. For information about Family Sharing, please see the Learn More link to “A Guide to Family Sharing” found by going to Settings, tapping your Apple ID and tapping Family.

iMessage and FaceTime

When you sign in with your Apple ID on your Mac, you will be signed in to iMessage and FaceTime automatically. Your Apple ID and/or phone number will be shown to the people you contact, and people can reach you using your Apple ID, and email address(es) or phone numbers on your account. You can select which phone number or email address(es) you’d like to start new conversations from, and which phone numbers or email addresses you can be reached at in iMessage settings and can add and verify additional “Reachable At” information from your Apple ID account page.

To determine if people you contact can be reached by iMessage, FaceTime, HomeKit invitations, or Activity Sharing, Apple will receive their phone numbers and email addresses and retains this information, associated with your Apple ID, for up to 30 days to operate and improve the service.

We use end-to-end encryption to protect your iMessage and FaceTime conversations across all your devices. With watchOS and iOS, your messages are encrypted on your device so that they can’t be accessed without your passcode. We designed iMessage and FaceTime so that there’s no way for us to decrypt your data when it’s in transit between devices. You can choose to automatically delete your messages from your device after 30 days or a year or to keep them on your device forever. iMessage and SMS messages are backed up on iCloud for your convenience, but you can turn iCloud Backup off whenever you want. And we never store the content of FaceTime calls on any servers.

iTunes & App Store & Music

When you sign in with your Apple ID on your Mac, you will be signed in to the iTunes Store, App Store, and Apple Music automatically so that you can make purchases or begin using Apple Music quickly and easily. Any purchases you choose to make will be recorded in our systems so you can re-download them at any time. If you use Apple Music, your listening history may be retained and used to help provide personalized recommendations in “For You”. You can choose not to share your listening history from Apple Music settings. 

If iTunes Match is available in your region and you use iTunes Match, iCloud will collect information about media in your iTunes library, and either match media to songs currently available in the iTunes Store or upload songs that cannot be matched, after which those songs can be accessed by your eligible devices.

For more information about iTunes & App Store & Music, please refer to the “About Stores & Privacy”.

Game Center

When you sign in with your Apple ID on your Mac, you will be signed in to Game Center automatically. Game Center allows you to engage in game related activities, including, but not limited to, participation in leader boards, multi-player games, and tracking achievements.

When you use Game Center, your Game Center nickname and any associated data may be visible to other users. When playing a game that supports multiplayer functionality, other users accessing the Game Center from within the same game on the same Wi-Fi network, local area network or within range of Bluetooth will be able to see that you are nearby (unless you turn this feature off), and see your nickname. Only users with whom you have invited into a friend relationship can see your real name; only your nickname will be visible to users who you did not request to be your friend.

At all times, information received by Apple will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, which can be found at www.apple.com/privacy

## Apple Music

Apple Music is designed to protect your information and enable you to choose what you share.

- Apple collects information about your Apple Music activity, such as the songs you play and how long you play them, to personalize the service when you are subscribed, and compensate our partners.

- iCloud Music Library sends information from your music library to Apple, such as song and artist names, to identify and unlock copies of any of your songs that are also available in Apple Music.

- We associate your iCloud Music Library information with you for as long as you remain subscribed and for a short time after. We retain records of the songs you play for the periods specified by applicable laws relating to financial reporting.

Protecting the privacy and security of your information is a priority for everyone at Apple. We work hard to collect only the data we need to make your experience better, and when we do collect data we believe it’s important for you to know what we’re collecting and why we need it, so you can make informed choices. Apple Music, like every Apple product, is designed with these principles in mind.

Apple collects information about how you use Apple Music in order to tailor features to your musical tastes. These features include For You — where you see albums and playlists picked for you, Radio — which plays selections from your favorite artists and genres, and Connect — which can recommend new artists to follow or posts you’ll find interesting. We also use this information so that we can contact you about upcoming releases, new artists and other happenings on Apple Music that you may like.

If you want to connect or share with other people using Apple Music, you can create a personal profile by providing a user handle (e.g., @johnappleseed), display name and, if desired, a profile photo, and other information. Apple stores this information with your account so that you can access it from any of your devices. Your user handle, display name, and profile photo can appear alongside any content you post and activity that you share on Apple Music. Sharing and posting content are not currently intended for or available to Apple IDs for children.

Other people may also be able to find your Apple Music profile using the information that you’ve provided. 

You can make the contents of your profile, like listening activity and playlists, available only to those you choose. However, your profile information, such as handle, display name, photo, your followers, and who you are following, are always visible to everyone.

When you create a profile on Apple Music, we will recommend other people with whom you may connect. The phone numbers and email addresses of contacts in your address book are sent to Apple to determine if your contacts are Apple Music subscribers. Apple does not store any information from your address book. If you do not wish to be found by others based on information they have about you in their address books, you can change this in Account Settings by disabling “Allow Friends to Find You.”

You can also find more people to connect with on Apple Music, and be found by others, by connecting your accounts from social networks, such as Facebook or Instagram. When you do this, Apple Music will link your Apple Music account to your social network account and find friends on that social network who are also Apple Music subscribers. We do not retain any information about friends who are not Apple Music subscribers. If you later want to disconnect these social networks from your Apple Music account, you can do so in the settings for those connected social networks.

Information that you provide in your profile may be updated or removed by you at any time. Whenever you share online, you should think carefully about what you are making public. When you share from Apple Music to other websites or social networks, anything you share is governed by the privacy policies of those other services.

If your phone carrier offers Apple Music memberships, Apple may check your phone number to determine if you joined through a carrier partner. If you signed up through your carrier, your phone number is used to identify your account. We will use the phone number associated with your membership only to verify your account at sign in and to connect your Apple Music activity with your account.

iCloud Music Library, which is a benefit of your Apple Music membership, allows you to have access to the songs and playlists in your library from any of your devices. This feature sends information from your music library to Apple, such as song and artist names, in order to identify and unlock copies of any of your songs that are also available in Apple Music. Any songs that can’t be found in Apple Music are uploaded to your personal iCloud Music Library, so that you can have access to your complete collection from any of your devices. You can turn off iCloud Music Library in Settings on your device or in iTunes.

When you use Apple Music, we collect information about the songs and videos you play or add to your music library or playlists, and the content you love, comment or share. Information, such as the account, device, and IP address that you used to play music, where in Apple Music you were when you played it, the time you played it and for how long, is noted by and sent to Apple. We use this information to customize your Apple Music experience and to help us understand how Apple Music is being used so we may improve it. For example, this information can help us pick the music, videos and artist posts that we show you in For You, Radio, and Connect. It also allows us to make other recommendations to you, that reflect your tastes, pay royalties and prevent or take action against activities that are, or may be, in breach of the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions or applicable law. You can change your email preferences and opt in or out of receiving emails about new Apple Music content on appleid.apple.com

We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. For example, we may aggregate your non-personal information with that of other Apple Music users in order to improve the service.

All of this information is collected and used in accordance with our privacy policy which can be found at www.apple.com/privacy

Disclosure to Third Parties

We are obligated to provide some non-personal information about your use of Apple Music to strategic partners associated with this service, such as the record labels, so that they can measure the performance of their creative work, meet royalty and accounting requirements, and improve their products and services. We also provide aggregated non-personal statistics about listening activity and user demographics, such as age and gender, to artists so that they may better understand their audiences. Additionally, we may make available certain personal information, like your phone carrier, to partners that work with Apple to provide our products and services, or that help Apple market to customers.

iOS apps may request access to Apple Music and your Media Library. If you give such permission to an app, it can access information like your media library on device, whether you are an Apple Music subscriber, your music and video play activity, and your For You recommendations. A permitted app can also modify data associated with your account, such as which songs are in your library and playlists. You can disable an app’s access on your iOS device in Settings > Privacy > Media & Apple Music. If you have removed the app or granted an app access using a version of iOS prior to iOS 11, you can disable its access in your iTunes account settings.

• the name and billing address associated with your Apple ID, iTunes, or App Store account
• general information about your Apple ID, iTunes, and App Store account activity (e.g., whether you have a long history of transactions within iTunes)
• information about your device and, if using Apple Watch, the paired iOS device (e.g., a device identifier, phone number, the name, and model of your device)
• location at the time you add your card (if you have Location Services enabled
• account or device history of adding payment cards
• aggregated stats relating to the information from payment cards you’ve added or attempted to add to Apple Pay

To help you set up cards that you have, or have recently had, on other devices, Apple stores a card reference with your iCloud account that can be used with the card issuer or payment network to re-add the card after entering the security code. Apple Pay does not store the original credit, debit, or prepaid card number.

Paying with Apple Pay

Information shared when you make a payment

When you begin a payment within an app, on the web or within Business Chat using Apple Pay, to enable tax and shipping cost calculation, your zip code, postal code, or other equivalent information is provided to the app, website, or merchant. After you authorize the payment, other information requested by the merchant, such as a device-specific account number, your shipping address, or email address, is also provided. The card number from your credit, debit, or prepaid card is not provided when you use Apple Pay.

Apps and websites can check if you have set up Apple Pay

When using an app or a website that uses Apple Pay in iOS, watchOS, or macOS the app or website can check if you have Apple Pay enabled on that device. When visiting a website in Safari on an iOS device, or Mac to which a card cannot be added, the website can check if you have Apple Pay set up on an iPhone or Apple Watch using the same iCloud account. You may disable websites you visit from checking if Apple Pay is enabled by changing your settings. On iOS go to Settings > Safari > Check for Apple Pay. On macOS, go to Safari > Preferences > Privacy and uncheck “Allow websites to check if Apple Pay is set up.”

Apple transmits, but does not store your payment information

In order to securely transmit your payment information within apps, websites, and Business Chat, the information is sent to Apple in encrypted form, where it is briefly decrypted and re-encrypted with a merchant-specific key, so that only the merchant, the developer, or their payment processor can decrypt your payment information. When you make a payment on a Mac to which a card cannot be added, the Mac and the authorizing device communicate over an encrypted channel via Apple servers. Apple does not retain any of this information in a form that personally identifies you.

Making Person to Person Payments and Using Apple Pay Cash (U.S. only)

Apple Pay allows you to send and receive money from other people in Messages. When you receive money, it’s added to your Apple Pay Cash card that can be used to make purchases using Apple Pay in stores, in apps, and on the web. Person to person payments and the Apple Pay Cash account are services provided by Apple’s partner bank, Green Dot Bank.

Setting up Apple Pay Cash

When you set up Apple Pay Cash, the same information as when you add a credit or debit card may be shared with Green Dot Bank and with Apple Payments Inc.
Apple created Apple Payments Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, to protect your privacy by storing and processing information separately from the rest of Apple and in a way that the rest of Apple doesn’t know. This information is only used for troubleshooting, regulatory purposes, and to prevent fraud for Apple Pay Cash.

Verifying your identity

You may be asked to provide information including your name, address, and your social security number to the bank and their identity verification service provider to verify your identity and to comply with banking regulations. Information you provide to verify your identity will only be used for fraud prevention and to comply with U.S. financial regulations. Your name and address is securely stored by the partner bank and Apple Payments Inc. If needed to verify your identity, you may be asked to provide additional information, such as social security number, date of birth, answers to questions (e.g., confirm street name you have previously lived on), or a copy of your government ID. This additional information cannot be read by Apple.

Information shared when you use Apple Pay Cash

When you use Apple Pay Cash, including when you add money or transfer money to a bank account, our partner bank, Apple, and Apple Payments Inc. may use and store information about you, your device, and your account in order to process the transaction, prevent fraud, and comply with financial regulations. This information is similar to that described in “Adding Cards to Apple Pay” above, but does not include the location of your device.

Apple Payments Inc. will store and use your transaction data for troubleshooting, to prevent fraud, and to comply with financial regulations once a transaction is completed. The rest of Apple doesn’t know who you sent money to, received money from, or where you made a purchase with your Apple Pay Cash card.

To assist Apple Payments Inc. in preventing fraud when you are using Apple Pay to send, request, and receive money, Apple may provide it with approximate use patterns from your device about how frequently you communicate with that person by phone, email, or in Messages. No content of your communication is collected. This information is stored for a limited time, and in such a way that it is not linked to you unless the transaction with which it is associated is determined to require further analysis due to suspicious activity. You can view which transactions required further analysis by going to your Apple Pay Cash card transaction history.

When you transfer money to a bank account, your bank information including account number and routing number will be stored within iCloud keychain to simplify future transfers. This information is encrypted and cannot be read by Apple or Apple Payments Inc.

Closing your Apple Pay Cash Account

If you close your Apple Pay Cash account, information about the account, including transaction history, will be retained as required by law and for fraud prevention.

You can learn more about how Green Dot Bank protects your personal information by reviewing their privacy policy at: https://applepaycash.greendot.com/privacy/

Transit Cards

If you choose to add an Apple Pay-enabled transit card to Wallet where this is available, information about your transit card will be associated with your iCloud account. If you add more than one transit card to Wallet, Apple or its partners may be able to link personal and account information associated between cards, for example personalized travel cards can be linked to non-personalized travel cards. In Japan, aggregate, non-personally identifiable, information about setting up transit cards in Apple Pay cards may be shared with mobile device carriers on a periodic basis.

When you use a transit card, information like recently visited stations, transaction history, and additional tickets may be accessed by a contactless card reader. This information can be accessed by any nearby contactless card reader, if the card is set as your Express Transit Card (a setting that allows you to complete transactions without Touch ID, Face ID, or a passcode). You can manage Express Transit on your iOS device by going to Settings or the Apple Watch app and tapping Wallet & Apple Pay.

Rewards and Gift Cards

Apple Pay also allows you to use eligible rewards and gift cards that are stored in Wallet to make contactless rewards and gift card transactions in select stores. If you add a rewards or gift card to Wallet, information about your account or card (including an identifier) will be stored on your device and synced via iCloud. You can disable iCloud syncing by going to Settings, tapping iCloud, and disabling “Wallet”.

When you use Apple Pay in stores, the payment terminal may request the rewards or gift card identifier from its associated rewards or gift card on your device as part of the transaction. You can disable this functionality by selecting the card in Wallet and disabling Automatic Selection in the card details. In select stores, if the payment terminal does not receive a rewards card identifier from your device, when you pay using Apple Pay, it may trigger a notification asking if you would like to add your rewards card to Apple Pay or sign up for the merchant’s rewards program if you are not a member. In the case of rewards sign up, the merchant may request that you provide information to them such as your name, postal code, email address, and phone number. While Apple will receive notice when you personalize a merchant’s rewards card, the information you share will be sent directly from your device to the merchant and treated in accordance with the merchant’s privacy policy.

Other Information

If you have Location Services turned on, the location of your device at the time you use it to make purchases in stores may be sent anonymously to Apple and will be used to help Apple Pay improve the accuracy of business names in the Wallet card transaction history and may be retained in aggregate to improve other Apple products and services. You may disable this location-based functionality of Apple Pay at any time by going to the Location Services setting on your iOS device and turning off the individual location setting for Wallet. On a Mac, go to System Preferences, Security & Privacy, Privacy, Location Services, and turn off location for Wallet & Apple Pay.

Apple Pay data that has been disassociated from you may be retained for a limited period of time to generally improve Apple Pay and other Apple products and services.

The terms of cardmember agreements you may have in place with your card issuer or payment network will continue to govern the use of your payment cards and their use in connection with Apple Pay, and such terms may have additional privacy policies.

You can learn more about how Apple protects your personal information by reviewing our Privacy Policy at: www.apple.com/privacy

## Apple Podcasts

Apple Podcasts is designed to protect your information and enable you to choose what you share.

- Your podcast listening data is linked to a random device identifier that is not associated with your Apple ID.

- We collect your podcast listening data in order to understand, and report to podcast publishers in an aggregate manner about podcast listening activity.

- Your use of Apple Podcasts, e.g. clicks, is linked to your Apple ID.

Protecting the privacy and security of your information is a priority for everyone at Apple. We work hard to collect only the data we need to make your experience better, and when we do collect data we believe it’s important for you to know what we’re collecting and why we need it, so you can make informed choices. Apple Podcasts, like every Apple product and service, is designed with these principles in mind.

As described here, Apple collects information about your use of Apple Podcasts to manage your subscriptions, to help improve the service, and to provide aggregated reporting to podcast providers.

As a convenience to you, Apple Podcasts syncs your subscriptions and the play position of the podcast episodes you are listening to so that you can enjoy the same Apple Podcasts experience from any of your devices. This information is stored in association with your Apple ID. You may disable this capability at any time in iTunes > Preferences > Store > Sync podcast subscriptions and settings. 

Also, to help improve the service, we collect information about your interactions with Apple Podcasts, such as buttons you click on. This information is also associated with your Apple ID. 

We collect playback data in order to understand, and provide reports about, podcast listenership. Playback data includes information about the podcasts you listen to, such as, how much of a podcast you listen to, and when you listen. We designed Apple Podcasts so that playback data is not linked to other Apple services. This information is associated with a random unique identifier that is specific to Apple Podcasts and not associated with your Apple ID. We use iCloud to sync the identifier across your devices that are logged in to iCloud. To reset the identifier included in playback data sent to Apple, on macOS, go to iTunes > Preferences > Advanced > Reset Identifier.

We share data with podcast providers only in aggregate form. We do not share any of your individual data with third parties. Keep in mind, however, that when you play or download podcast episodes from podcast providers, those providers may be able to collect information about your use of their podcasts, and that collection is governed by their privacy practices.

Apple may use information about your use of Apple Podcasts to prevent or take action against activities that are, or may be, in breach of any applicable Software License Agreement or applicable law.

Any information collected or used by Apple is in accordance with our privacy policy available at www.apple.com/privacy

## Ask Siri and Dictation

Siri is designed to protect your information and enable you to choose what you share.

When you use Dictation, you can choose to have either your Mac or Apple’s servers perform the speech recognition for you. If you use Enhanced Dictation, your Mac will convert what you say into text without sending your dictated speech to Apple. 

When you use Ask Siri and non-Enhanced Dictation the things you say and dictate will be recorded and sent to Apple to process your requests. Your device will also send Apple other information, such as your name and nickname; the names, nicknames, and relationship with you (e.g., “my dad”) of your contacts, music you enjoy, the names of your photo albums, the names of Apps installed on your device (collectively, your “User Data”). All of this data is used to help Ask Siri and Dictation on your Mac understand you better and recognize what you say. It is not linked to other data that Apple may have from your use of other Apple services.

If you have Location Services turned on, the location of your Mac at the time you make a request will also be sent to Apple to help Ask Siri and Dictation improve the accuracy of its response to your requests. You may choose to turn off Location Services for Ask Siri and Dictation. To do so, open System Preferences on your Mac, click Security & Privacy, click Privacy, click Location Services, click the lock to make changes and enter your password, and uncheck the “Siri & Dictation”.

You may choose to turn off Ask Siri or Dictation at any time. To turn off Ask Siri, open System Preferences on your Mac, click Siri, and uncheck the “Enable Ask Siri” box. To turn off Dictation, open System Preferences, click Keyboard, click Dictation, and click the Dictation “Off” radio button.  If you turn off both Ask Siri and Dictation, Apple will delete your User Data, as well as your recent voice input data. Older voice input data that has been disassociated from you may be retained for a period of time to generally improve Ask Siri, Dictation and dictation functionality in other Apple products and services. This voice input data may include audio files and transcripts of what you said, related diagnostic data, such as hardware and operating system specifications and performance statistics, and the approximate location of your device at the time the request was made.

You can also restrict the ability to use Ask Siri & Dictation altogether under the Parental Controls preferences.

By using Ask Siri or Dictation, you agree and consent to Apple’s and its subsidiaries’ and agents’ transmission, collection, maintenance, processing, and use of this information, including your voice input, User Data, to provide and improve Siri, Dictation, and dictation functionality in other Apple products and services. 

At all times, information collected by Apple will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, which can be found at www.apple.com/privacy

## Device Analytics

Analytics is designed to protect your information and enable you to choose what you share.

With your permission, macOS can automatically collect analytics information from your Mac and send it to Apple to help improve the quality and performance of its products. This information is sent only with your consent and is submitted anonymously to Apple.

Further details

If you agree to send Mac Analytics information to Apple, it may include the following:

Details about app or system crashes, freezes, or kernel panics

Information about events on your Mac (for example, whether a certain function such as waking your Mac was successful or not)

Usage information (for example, data about how you use Apple and third-party software, hardware, and services)

Analytics data contains your computer’s hardware and software specifications, including information about devices connected to your Mac and the versions of the operating system and apps you’re using on your Mac. Personal data is either not logged at all in the reports generated by your Mac, is subject to privacy preserving techniques such as differential privacy, or is removed from any reports before they’re sent to Apple. If you want to add a description of your actions when the problem occurred, click the disclosure triangle and enter your comments. Please do not provide personal information.

Data can be sent automatically if one of these events occurs:

An app quits unexpectedly

You choose to force an app to quit

A system error occurs that causes your Mac to restart, or requires you to restart your Mac

If you agree, we may share your crash data with Apple’s partners and third-party developers to improve their software, hardware, and services designed for use with Apple products. Apple may also provide such partners and third-party developers with a subset of analytics information that is relevant to that partner’s or developer’s software, hardware, and/or services, as long as the information is in a form that does not personally identify you.

Information is sent to Apple using your Internet connection. If your Mac is not connected to the Internet, the data is saved and sent the next time you connect to the Internet.

Your Mac keeps analytics information for one month after it is generated, then deletes the information.

Opt-out of sharing analytics

You can opt-out of sharing analytics from your Mac at any time:

Choose Apple menu > System Preferences, click Security & Privacy, then click Privacy.

Click Analytics.

Deselect “Share Mac Analytics.”

Deselect “Share with App Developers” to stop sharing analytics data with app developers.

Analytics information will no longer be sent to Apple.

View analytics information

You can use the Console app to view analytics information sent to Apple:

1. Open Console.
2. In the Console sidebar, click Mac Analytics Data.

Console shows analytics information even if you did not select to send reports automatically.

SubmitDiagInfo entries indicate when analytics information was sent to Apple.

If you are logged in as an administrator user, you can view all reports. If you are not logged in as an administrator, you can view only User Reports.

Privacy policy

All analytics information is sent to Apple anonymously.

By using these features, you agree and consent to Apple’s and its subsidiaries’ and agents’ transmission, collection, maintenance, processing, and use of this information as described above.

At all times, information collected by Apple will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, which can be found at www.apple.com/privacy

## iBooks

App Store, iTunes Store, iBooks Store, Videos, and iTunes U are designed to protect your information and let you choose when you share.

- We collect your personal information so that we can provide you the content you purchase, download, or wish to update.

- We also use information about your account, browsing, purchases, and downloads in the Stores to offer advertising to ensure that Search Ads in the App Store and ads in Apple News, where available, are relevant to you. You have choices with respect to this advertising, as described below.

- We use information about your purchases, downloads, and other activities in the Stores to tailor features and offer personalized recommendations for you. You can opt out of the use of this data for this purpose, as described below.

- To find ways to improve our Stores, we use information about your browsing, purchases, searches, and downloads. These records are stored with IP address, a random unique identifier (where that arises), and Apple ID when you are signed in to a Store.

Providing the Stores

We use your personal information to provide the services and features in the Stores. This information includes, for example, your account and payment information, which you can access and change in settings, and your purchase history.

When you download from a Store, or install an app on your Apple Watch, identifiers such as your device’s hardware ID and IP address are logged by Apple along with your Apple ID.

In order to preserve your play position in the Videos app, we store and sync that position across your signed-in iOS devices.

Improving the Stores

To improve the experience in the Stores, we collect information about your usage of the Stores, including when you open or close a Store, what content you search for, and the content you view and download. We also collect information about your device such as the type of device, the version of your operating system, and the amount of free space on your device. We may use this information to assess whether requested content can be downloaded, to understand general trends in use of device storage, and whether your device is connected by Wi-Fi or cellular. We can use this information to improve your experience in the Stores in the following ways: 
 
What you searched for makes it possible for us to offer trending searches

Knowing what content you viewed or download makes it possible for us to offer personalized features like “More Games You Might Like”

Knowing the free space on your device allowed us to build the feature that lets you buy movies on your iPhone without downloading it at purchase

Additionally, if you have Popular Near Me enabled in Location Services, your iPhone will periodically send locations of when and where you have purchased or used apps in an anonymous and encrypted form to Apple, and may then be used to offer geographically relevant apps and other Apple products and services.

Personalizing the Stores

We may personalize the Stores to help you discover the content that’s most relevant to you. For example, we recommend movies that we think will be of interest to you based on movies you’ve previously watched. Personalization features can be turned off by sliding the Personalized Recommendations switch for your Apple ID in the iTunes & App Store Settings, and some may require your permission before they are turned on. To provide personalization, we use information about your purchases, downloads, browsing, and other activities in the Stores. This information is stored in association with your Apple ID.

Advertising

Search Ads is an easy way for developers to promote their apps within App Store search results, helping people discover apps. We use information about your device, account, purchases, downloads, and browsing, including search terms, in Stores in order to ensure that ads in the Stores are relevant. We create groups of people, called segments, who share similar characteristics and we use these groups for delivering targeted ads. Information about you is used to determine which segments you are assigned to, and thus, which ads you receive. To protect your privacy, your information is used to place you into segments of at least 5,000 people. If you do not wish to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple’s advertising platform, you can choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking, which will opt your Apple ID out of receiving such ads on devices where you are signed in with the same Apple ID.

We also use similar information from the Stores to make ads in Apple News more relevant, but in a way that is tied to an identifier specific to Apple News and not tied to your Apple ID. 

Learn more About Advertising & Privacy in Search Ads and News here. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205223

Learn about how to opt out of interest-based ads in the App Store and Apple News here. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074

If you choose to limit ad tracking, you will still receive ads based on search terms you enter.

Sharing with third parties

We are obligated to provide some non-personal information about your content purchases to strategic partners, such as app developers and/or content owners so that they can measure the performance of their creative work, meet royalty and accounting requirements, and improve their products and services.

We may share information with developers to help them operate and improve their apps. Developers can access usage information, provided by users who opt in, that allows them to look at aggregated data from groups of users that have similar characteristics or behavior, as long the data comes from groups of no less than five users. Developers can access receipt information for purchases of their products and services in the Stores. Receipts do not include personal information; however, developers could seek to associate them with personal information from your use and download of their apps, if you have provided it to them.

If you purchase a subscription in a third-party app, we create a Subscriber ID that is unique to you and the developer or publisher. You can learn more about Subscriber ID here https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207233.	

Retention

We retain personal information associated with your purchases and downloads on our Stores for the periods specified by applicable laws relating to financial reporting which vary by country. For most customers that requires at least a ten year retention period. We also retain a record of your purchase and downloads of content for at least as long as you have an account with us to allow you to redownload that content in line with our applicable terms on redownloads. We retain other information such as browsing activity and searches for a shorter period. The period chosen takes account of applicable legal requirements to retain data and specific business use cases. However, some information, such as purchases, but not your stored card details may be retained as business records even after you close your account or stop using the Stores.

Preventing fraud and other malicious activity

We also collect personal information to prevent fraud and other malicious activity in the Stores and other Apple apps and services. This information includes device information, such as device type and software version, location information, if available, download and purchase history, and other interactions with the Stores.

At all times Apple collects and uses information in accordance with our privacy policy located at www.apple.com/privacy

## iCloud Analytics

Analytics is designed to protect your information and enable you to choose what you share.

Help Apple improve its products and services, including Siri and other intelligent features, by allowing analytics of usage and data from your iCloud account. All analysis of data from your iCloud account including text snippets from email messages or other similar data in your account is undertaken only after the data has undergone privacy preserving techniques such as differential privacy so that it is not associated with you or your account.

You can opt-out of sharing iCloud Analytics in one of two ways:

Choose Apple menu > System Preferences, click Security & Privacy, click Privacy, click Analytics, then deselect “Share iCloud Analytics.”

Go to appleid.apple.com. Under the Privacy section, click Manage Settings, then deselect “Share iCloud Analytics.”

However, some information, such as purchases, but not your stored card details may be retained as business records even after you close your account or stop using the Stores.

Preventing fraud and other malicious activity

We also collect personal information to prevent fraud and other malicious activity in the Stores and other Apple apps and services. This information includes device information, such as device type and software version, location information, if available, download and purchase history, and other interactions with the Stores.

At all times Apple collects and uses information in accordance with our privacy policy located at www.apple.com/privacy

## iTunes U

App Store, iTunes Store, iBooks Store, Videos, and iTunes U are designed to protect your information and let you choose when you share.

- We collect your personal information so that we can provide you the content you purchase, download, or wish to update.

- We also use information about your account, browsing, purchases, and downloads in the Stores to offer advertising to ensure that Search Ads in the App Store and ads in Apple News, where available, are relevant to you. You have choices with respect to this advertising, as described below.

- We use information about your purchases, downloads, and other activities in the Stores to tailor features and offer personalized recommendations for you. You can opt out of the use of this data for this purpose, as described below.

- To find ways to improve our Stores, we use information about your browsing, purchases, searches, and downloads. These records are stored with IP address, a random unique identifier (where that arises), and Apple ID when you are signed in to a Store.

Providing the Stores

We use your personal information to provide the services and features in the Stores. This information includes, for example, your account and payment information, which you can access and change in settings, and your purchase history.

When you download from a Store, or install an app on your Apple Watch, identifiers such as your device’s hardware ID and IP address are logged by Apple along with your Apple ID.

In order to preserve your play position in the Videos app, we store and sync that position across your signed-in iOS devices.

Improving the Stores

To improve the experience in the Stores, we collect information about your usage of the Stores, including when you open or close a Store, what content you search for, and the content you view and download. We also collect information about your device such as the type of device, the version of your operating system, and the amount of free space on your device. We may use this information to assess whether requested content can be downloaded, to understand general trends in use of device storage, and whether your device is connected by Wi-Fi or cellular. We can use this information to improve your experience in the Stores in the following ways: 
 
What you searched for makes it possible for us to offer trending searches

Knowing what content you viewed or download makes it possible for us to offer personalized features like “More Games You Might Like”

Knowing the free space on your device allowed us to build the feature that lets you buy movies on your iPhone without downloading it at purchase

Additionally, if you have Popular Near Me enabled in Location Services, your iPhone will periodically send locations of when and where you have purchased or used apps in an anonymous and encrypted form to Apple, and may then be used to offer geographically relevant apps and other Apple products and services.

Personalizing the Stores

We may personalize the Stores to help you discover the content that’s most relevant to you. For example, we recommend movies that we think will be of interest to you based on movies you’ve previously watched. Personalization features can be turned off by sliding the Personalized Recommendations switch for your Apple ID in the iTunes & App Store Settings, and some may require your permission before they are turned on. To provide personalization, we use information about your purchases, downloads, browsing, and other activities in the Stores. This information is stored in association with your Apple ID.

Advertising

Search Ads is an easy way for developers to promote their apps within App Store search results, helping people discover apps. We use information about your device, account, purchases, downloads, and browsing, including search terms, in Stores in order to ensure that ads in the Stores are relevant. We create groups of people, called segments, who share similar characteristics and we use these groups for delivering targeted ads. Information about you is used to determine which segments you are assigned to, and thus, which ads you receive. To protect your privacy, your information is used to place you into segments of at least 5,000 people. If you do not wish to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple’s advertising platform, you can choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking, which will opt your Apple ID out of receiving such ads on devices where you are signed in with the same Apple ID.

We also use similar information from the Stores to make ads in Apple News more relevant, but in a way that is tied to an identifier specific to Apple News and not tied to your Apple ID. 

Learn more About Advertising & Privacy in Search Ads and News here. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205223

Learn about how to opt out of interest-based ads in the App Store and Apple News here. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074

If you choose to limit ad tracking, you will still receive ads based on search terms you enter.

Sharing with third parties

We are obligated to provide some non-personal information about your content purchases to strategic partners, such as app developers and/or content owners so that they can measure the performance of their creative work, meet royalty and accounting requirements, and improve their products and services.

We may share information with developers to help them operate and improve their apps. Developers can access usage information, provided by users who opt in, that allows them to look at aggregated data from groups of users that have similar characteristics or behavior, as long the data comes from groups of no less than five users. Developers can access receipt information for purchases of their products and services in the Stores. Receipts do not include personal information; however, developers could seek to associate them with personal information from your use and download of their apps, if you have provided it to them.

If you purchase a subscription in a third-party app, we create a Subscriber ID that is unique to you and the developer or publisher. You can learn more about Subscriber ID here https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207233.	

Retention

We retain personal information associated with your purchases and downloads on our Stores for the periods specified by applicable laws relating to financial reporting which vary by country. For most customers that requires at least a ten year retention period. We also retain a record of your purchase and downloads of content for at least as long as you have an account with us to allow you to redownload that content in line with our applicable terms on redownloads. We retain other information such as browsing activity and searches for a shorter period. The period chosen takes account of applicable legal requirements to retain data and specific business use cases. However, some information, such as purchases, but not your stored card details may be retained as business records even after you close your account or stop using the Stores.

Preventing fraud and other malicious activity

We also collect personal information to prevent fraud and other malicious activity in the Stores and other Apple apps and services. This information includes device information, such as device type and software version, location information, if available, download and purchase history, and other interactions with the Stores.

At all times Apple collects and uses information in accordance with our privacy policy located at www.apple.com/privacy

## Location Services

Location Services is designed to protect your information and enable you to choose what you share.

Location Services allows apps and websites to gather and use information based on the current location of your computer. Your approximate location is determined using information from local Wi-Fi networks, and is collected by Location Services in a manner that doesn’t personally identify you.

When you use Spotlight or Safari Suggestions in Safari, the location of your Mac at the time you submit a search query to Spotlight or Safari will be sent by Apple to make Spotlight Suggestions and Safari Suggestions more relevant and to improve other Apple products and services. If you turn off Location Services for Spotlight Suggestions and Safari Suggestions, your precise location will not be sent to Apple. To deliver relevant search suggestions, Apple may use the IP address of your internet connection to approximate your location by matching it to a geographic region. 

Apps that you have allowed to use Location Services appear in the Privacy pane of Security & Privacy preferences. Checkboxes show whether Location Services is turned on or off for an app. If you don’t want to allow Location Services for one or more apps, you can turn it off by deselecting the checkbox next to the app. If you turn Location Services off for an app, you’re prompted to turn it on again the next time that app tries to use your location data.

You can also turn off Location Services altogether by deselecting Enable Location Services in the Privacy pane of Security & Privacy preferences. Even if you disable Location Services, third party applications and websites may still use other ways to determine your location. For safety purposes, however, your Mac’s location information may be used for emergency calls to aid response efforts regardless of whether you enable Location Services.

If you allow third party apps or websites to use your current location, you are subject to their terms and privacy policy and not the Apple Privacy Policy. You should review their terms and privacy policies to understand how they treat and use your location information.

By using these features, you agree and consent to Apple’s and its subsidiaries’ and agents’ transmission, collection, maintenance, processing and use of this information as described above.

At all times, information collected by Apple will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, which can be found at www.apple.com/privacy

When your issue relates to a third-party, Apple may provide the third-party with information from your reported issue to help fix the issue you identified. Apple only shares information with such third-parties when necessary to fix an issue and first seeks to delete any information from which you can be identified.

## Search

Search is designed to protect your information and enable you to choose what you share.

Siri analyzes how you use your device to provide personalized suggestions and better search

Siri learns how you use your devices in order to personalize your experience. Using information stored on your device, such as your Safari browsing history, emails, messages, and contacts, as well as information contributed by other installed apps, Siri can provide suggestions in Spotlight, Look Up, Photos Memories, and more. You can see the full list of features that Siri personalizes in the Siri section of System Preferences, under Siri Suggestions & Privacy.

Personalization is synced across your devices with end-to-end encryption

Siri securely syncs this information among your devices, to make your experience consistent on all of them. This sync is done using end-to-end encryption.

To make suggestions and search results more relevant, some information is sent to Apple and not associated with you

In some cases, such as when you use Siri Suggestions in Spotlight, Look Up, or Safari, generalized topics of interest that Siri has learned may be sent to Apple to make your searches more relevant. These topics of interest (for example, cooking or basketball) will help to give you more relevant search results, and we use privacy-friendly techniques to disassociate these topics of interest from you.

In addition to these topics of interest, when you perform a search, your device sends your search queries, suggestions you have selected, and related usage data to Apple to process your request. This information is not associated with you. Search results that show files and content on your device will not be sent.

If you have Location Services on your device turned on, the location of your device will be sent to Apple to provide more relevant recommendations. Searches for common words and phrases may be forwarded from Apple to a search engine. These searches are not stored by the search engine provider. To provide you with more relevant music and video suggestions, if your device can access music or video subscription services, then information such as the names of the subscription services and types of subscriptions may be sent to Apple. Your account name, number and password will not be sent to Apple. Location, search queries, your interests, and usage information sent to Apple will only be used by Apple to make Suggestions more relevant and to improve other Apple products and services.

You have choice and control
